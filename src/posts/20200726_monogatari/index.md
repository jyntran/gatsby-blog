Lately I have been playing with [Monogatari](https://monogatari.io/), a visual novel engine that is for the web and is built around JavaScript.

So far, I'm liking it. The documentation is pretty sparse in some areas, but there is a Discord channel that seems pretty active and other developers can get help fairly quickly.

I will likely put up some snippets for various features as I play around with it. We'll see how it goes!
