So what is a Gist and why should I use one over my GitHub?

This occurred to me after I attempted to write a [quick FizzBang program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz#Programming_interviews) in C++. The purpose is to see how I approach a seemingly simple program while trying to follow the various methodologies programmers usually here such as _Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)_ and _Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)_. It could be greatly improved, but for now my focus is on brushing up my other programming skills and knowledge so that I can ace interviews, or at least approach it closely enough.

A short snippet of C code - worthy of sharing, surely, but opening a new repo just for FizzBang programs seems a little overboard. Then I realized that long ago I had starred someone else's snippet on a GitHub-like site: [Gist](https://gist.github.com/). I did a quick lookover and it seemed it will serve my purpose just fine. Each Gist can handle multiple files, counts revisions, tracks comments in Markdown, provides embed code, and a few other things that GitHub repos enjoy - like a super-featured pastebin.

What Gists don't offer are branches and forks, so the idea of using Gists as simple coding demonstrations rather than mini projects is what sticks out to me. I find that this could be useful later on, but only if there is some way to spotlight my Gists; I noticed that any contributions to my Gists are not counted towards my contributions on GitHub.

So, [here](https://gist.github.com/jyntran) is my Gist for any who are curious. Look out for more interesting snippets in the future.
