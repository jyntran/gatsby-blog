Waterloo uses Eduroam as its central Wi-Fi network. For many devices such as laptops and smartphones, connecting to it is a cinch. There are other devices that unfortunately can't connect to Eduroam due to its encryption: it's WPA2/Enterprise and it's not supported by all devices.

To connect to the university's unsecured network, your device needs to be on the university network's whitelist. This can be done by contacting one of the [IST Service Desks](https://uwaterloo.ca/information-systems-technology/services/ist-service-desk/about-ist-service-desk) and giving them your device's MAC address. This is a network card ID unique to each device.

The list of connection guides is right here: [Connection Guides](https://uwaterloo.ca/housing/technology/internet/equipment-setup)

Note that the network you want is not Eduroam; it's `uw-wifi-setup-no-encryption` network, which isn't all that secure but it'll at least let you connect to the Internet.

Now I can get system updates on my 3DS while on campus instead of waiting until I get home. I know I always forget when I come home!
