This blog is now a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) blog!

From Hexo, it was a little rough with the different header metadata, but seeing as both use Markdown files to generate posts, it could have been much worse.

So far, setting up Gatsby v2 is a smooth process. There's also plenty to customize from what I see, from setting up templates to overriding Typography.js themes.

The image rendering is beautiful, thanks to [gatsby-remark-images](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-images/), especially the neat unblur transition.

Some things I'm considering:
- reorganize components/templates folders
- go-to-top button
- nicer looking headers
- colour scheme change?
- more styling tweaks as I go

Before all that, I want to set up an automatic deployment process, that is, run `gatsby build` after the repo's master branch is updated. Let's see how that goes.
