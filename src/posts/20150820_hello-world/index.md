I thought I would start trying a blog platform on NodeJS and see how it goes. This is Hexo, which was simple to set up and looks pretty nice to boot.

In the future though, I would like to create a custom theme. I haven't worked with Swig templates before but it'll be a worthwhile experience.

Broken features at the moment: missing Atom feed and a search bar that returns nothing. Not a big deal, but they are nice to have.
