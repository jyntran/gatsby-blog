My domain has been in disarray for some time now. Plans have been made to move to a different VPS, deploy sites from scratch, and basically clear out any obsolete dependencies and malformed permissions. Most of all, I want to try Nginx with nodeJS to see how it fares in performance. This is what I'm working on in the mean time, so keep posted. I'm also trying to update my Twitter more often as well.
